# space_shooter
Small and easy space shooter video game. Made for fun, just to see if I could.

<p>I wanted to see if I could make a simple video game. I followed a tutorial to do the basics, then added my own touches to the game. For example, I didn't like how slippery the movement felt, so I figured out how to adjust it to be more precise. It's still a work in progress. I'll continue to work on it when I have some more time. It was fun! I hope that soon I will have the time to really finish it and put the polish on it that I want so that I can code something that's 100% mine.</p>
